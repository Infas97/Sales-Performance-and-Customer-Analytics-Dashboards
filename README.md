## Overview

The dashboards were created as part of a comprehensive analytics project to evaluate and visualize business performance in three critical areas:
1. **Sales Performance**: Track sales trends and key metrics across timeframes and product categories.  
2. **Product Metrics**: Understand product-related costs and inventory performance.  
3. **Customer Metrics**: Gain insights into customer behavior and lifetime value.  

The dashboards were built using **Power BI** for their robust visualization and data modeling capabilities.
